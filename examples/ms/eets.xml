<argument><p>The Editor's Preface gives an account of the background 
and aims of the
project, an introduction to the use of the website, and a review
of the problems involved in e-editing.</p></argument>              

<div><head>The background</head>
<p>This project developed from EETS Council's wish to explore the
possibility of future publication of EETS editions of Old and Middle
English works in electronic form—not as a substitute for traditional
publication methods, but as a supplementary means of publication which
might offer specific academic advantages, such as searchability and
the inclusion of additional material (e.g., MS transcriptions and
reproductions) which could not be as easily provided in a printed
edition.</p>

<p>A subcommittee of Council reached the consensus that the most
practical starting-point would probably be a <soCalled>translation</soCalled> model,
taking the printed edition as its starting-point and using
relatively light mark-up (which could, if necessary, be done by
someone other than the original editor).</p>
<p>This trial electronic edition of the Preface to Ancrene Wisse is
based on a non-electronic edition of the full text currently being
prepared for publication by EETS. It includes most of the
components of a traditional EETS edition, but the electronic
edition also includes a translation (no longer provided by most
EETS editions), and reproductions and transcriptions of the
relevant sections of three important early manuscripts.</p>
</div>

<div><head>Project aims</head>

<list type="ordered">
<item>To develop an agreed set of conventions for marking up EETS
    editions for electronic publication in XML (eXtensible Markup
    Language), conforming to the TEI Guidelines. XML is currently being
    developed as an international standard mark-up language, less
    difficult to use and more Web-compatible than its predecessor SGML
    (Standard Generalized Markup Language). The resulting DTD
    (Document Type Description) should be usable with only minor
    modifications for future EETS editions.</item>

<item>To develop a user interface which will ensure that the electronic edition is at least as easy to use as a printed edition, and offers some added facilities.</item>  
 </list>
 </div>

<div><head>Specifications</head> <p>For a brief discussion of the XML
   encoding used for this edition, see Lou Burnard's <ref target="tagging.html">Tagging Guide for
EETS electronic editions</ref>; this also includes a link to the XML
   source files.</p>
<p>Since XML is, at least
in theory, <q>platform-independent</q> (i.e. it offers a form of
mark-up which is not tied to one particular publication medium), the
choice of user interface made here does not commit EETS in the longer
term to any particular form of electronic publication (e.g. WWW as
opposed to CD-ROM). Those working on the project, however, agreed that
there was a good case in the first instance for developing a WWW
interface, since this offers greater accessibility than CD-ROM
publication, and the potential for linkage with major on-line
collections of material (e.g., the <ref target="http://ets.umdl.umich.edu/m/mec/"> Middle English
Compendium</ref>).</p>

<p>The website is designed for a minimum screen resolution of 600x800
pixels, using Internet Explorer 5 / Netscape 5 or above.  </p></div>

<div><head>Using the website</head>

<div><head>Navigation</head>

<p>The website uses standard modern conventions of website layout to make navigation easier and more intuitive for its users (on these conventions, see Gerry McGovern, Rob Norton, and Catherine O'Dowd, <title>The Web Content Style Guide</title> (London: Prentice Hall,
2002), ch. 2, <title level="a">Designing for the Web</title>).</p>
<p>A search facility is provided on every page. Core navigation, directing users to the main sections of the edition, is in a sidebar to the left of each main page, and repeated in text form at the foot of the page. For MS reproductions, and for the parallel text and translation, the full width of the page is used; these pages, instead of a sidebar, have sub-menus at the top of the page, linking them to a parent page.</p>
<p>Other features have been added to this standard layout to make it
easier to move between different parts of the edition.</p>
  </div>
<div><head>Numbered paragraphs</head>

<p><title>Ancrene Wisse</title> is a long work (over 200 printed pages), and although it has a clear overall structure (divided into a Preface and eight Parts or <lat>distinctiones</lat>), there is relatively little formal subdivision within the major sections.  This causes
problems for an electronic edition (which tends to be primarily used for reference), as readers are not likely to want to scroll through long sections of text.</p> 

<p>Following a practice commonly used in editions of medieval Latin works, I have subdivided the text into numbered paragraphs to provide manageable shorter units and allow easier 'horizontal' cross-reference between different parts of the edition (e.g. it is possible to move from each paragraph of the edited text to the corresponding point in
the translation, Apparatus criticus, and notes). An <ref target="#AW-outline">outline summary</ref>, giving a brief account of the contents of each paragraph, has been provided as a substitute for chapter-headings in guiding the reader through the work; this includes
line-references for each paragraph (see further <ref target="#AW-pref-LN"><q>Line-numbering</q></ref> below).</p>
  </div>
<div><head>Internal linking</head>

<p>Other means of <q>horizontal</q> cross-reference are also used. In the
edited text, footnotes list major textual variants; in the Introduction and Textual Commentary, brief bibliographical references (e.g. <ref target="#Dobson-1976">Dobson,
1976</ref>) are linked to the full references in the booklist. It is also possible to cross-refer by folio between MS reproductions and transcriptions.
   </p>
  </div>

<div><head>Searching the site</head>
<p>A full-scale electronic edition would require a sophisticated (and
expensive) search engine capable of searching on XML tags. This trial
    website uses a simpler method: the basic <!-- ref target="AW-search">Search</ref--> facility can be used to find the page containing a particular word or string, and the page itself can be searched
using the <q>Find</q> facility in the Internet Explorer or Netscape web browser (under <q>Edit</q> in the top toolbar).
   </p>
  </div>
<div><head>Printing out</head>
<p>The text sections of the website can be printed out on A4 paper using
'Landscape' format.
   </p></div>
 </div>
<div><head>Problems</head>

<div><head>Simultaneous viewing</head>

<p>It is arguable that an electronic edition is not obliged to provide
more ease of cross-reference than a reader could reasonably expect
from a paper edition (e.g. text and notes do not have to be
simultaneously visible, as long as it is easy to move between them);
and there are no problems, at our proposed screen resolution, in
displaying <ref target="#AW-tt">text and translation</ref>
simultaneously. However, there are two areas where there is a strong
case for facilitating direct on-screen comparison. <!-- : between text
and Apparatus criticus, and between manuscript reproduction and
transcription. --> In this edition, a split-screen facility has been
provided for comparing manuscript reproductions with their
transcriptions, to illustrate how this can be done.
   </p>

  </div>
<div xml:id="AW-pref-LN" ><head>Line-numbering</head>
<p>Once the printed edition is published, its line-numbering can be embedded into the text of the electronic edition; before printing, however, the line-numbering of a prose text can only be provisional. The line-numbers embedded in the edited text reflect the lineation of Richard Dance's computer transcript, which he has used for the Glossary; however, since his
transcript does not include the Latin passages, I have retained (alongside his numbering) the folio/line-numbering of the base MS (Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 402, ed. <ref target="#Tolkien-1962">Tolkien 1962</ref>) in the Apparatus criticus and notes for greater precision of reference.
   </p></div>

<div xml:id="AW-pref-SC" ><head>Special characters</head>

<p>The main problem with Web publication is that there is no guarantee
that the user's browser will be able to display the special characters
used in the electronic edition. There are three possible ways of
dealing with this, none of them wholly satisfactory: by font download,
by the substitution of graphics for problem characters, and by
transliteration into more generally available characters. Font
downloads are inconvenient for the user, and not all the medieval
characters can be displayed in this way (the <lat>punctus
elevatus</lat>, for instance, is currently unavailable). The graphic
realization of characters makes searching more difficult, and can
cause problems with different browser settings. The third option,
transliteration, which I have chosen, is the simplest and most
accessible, but necessarily involves some loss of precision in the
reproduction of the original material. In this edition, it has been
possible to retain <q>thorn</q> and <q>eth</q>, since these characters
are supported by most browsers, but lower-case <q>yogh</q> is rendered
as <q>3</q>, upper-case <q>yogh</q> as <q>3</q> underlined, and
<q>wyn</q> as <q>w</q>. In the manuscript transcriptions, the
<lat>punctus</lat> is rendered as <q>.</q> <lat>punctus elevatus</lat>
is rendered as <q>;</q> and the <lat>punctus interrogativus</lat> as
<q>?</q> (it is important to note that in the context of the
transcriptions, these renderings are <hi>not</hi> modernizations of
the original punctuation, but carry the value of the medieval
characters they represent). See further <ref target="#AW-MSS-conv"><q>Conventions of transcription</q></ref>. With
XML mark-up, however, the nature of the special characters can be
recorded in the mark-up even when they cannot be displayed on the
screen (in which case it is possible to specify alternate
realizations).</p>
  </div>

<div><head>Manuscript reproductions</head>

<p>The manuscripts reproduced in the trial edition (see <ref target="#AW-MSS-repro">Manuscript reproductions</ref>) are relatively small, and can be shown at a reasonable level of quality even within a 760-pixel-wide screen space; but it should be possible for the user to have access to a larger-scale reproduction. The simplest way of doing
this would be to provide a larger screen image as an alternative (even
if this involved scrolling sideways). SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
technology could make it possible to provide a zoom facility, though
again this might require a software download by the user. </p></div>

    <div xml:id="AW-intro" ><head>Introduction</head>
<argument><p>The
Introduction deals with the edition itself: background information
on <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> and its Preface, descriptions of the MSS,
and an account of the principles and conventions of editing.</p></argument>


    <div xml:id="AW-front-intro1" ><head><title>Ancrene Wisse</title></head>
<p><title>Ancrene Wisse</title>, a Middle English <q>rule</q> or <q>guide</q> for female recluses, was composed in the West Midlands in the early thirteenth century. There is still no scholarly consensus on its exact date, localization, authorship, or audience, but recent research has helped to narrow down the possibilities, and to suggest at least what its broader cultural and institutional context might have been.</p>  

<p>It is a carefully-structured work, divided into the Preface edited here and eight parts (called by the author <lat>distinctiones</lat>). The first, which deals with the anchoresses' devotional routine, and the eighth, which covers their remaining outward observances, constitute the <q>Outer Rule</q>. The remaining <lat>distinctiones</lat>, which deal with the custody of the senses, the nature of the solitary life, the Seven Deadly Sins and their remedies, confession, penance, and the love of God, constitute the <q>Inner Rule</q>, and offer general spiritual guidance as well as specific advice on the anchoritic life. The work draws on a wide variety of sources: the Church Fathers, particularly Augustine of Hippo and Gregory the Great; later monastic writers, particularly Bernard of Clairvaux and Aelred of Rievaulx (whose Latin rule for anchoresses, <lat>De Institutione inclusarum</lat>, <lat>c.</lat> 1160, is an important source); and the pastoral manuals and preaching aids developed in the Paris schools during the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries (see <ref target="#Millett-1999">Millett 1999</ref>).</p>

<p><title>Ancrene Wisse</title> is clearly the work of a highly-educated author, but it does not assume an equally highly-educated audience; although both French and Latin versions survive, it seems to have been composed originally in Middle English, and most of the Latin it contains, apart from the prayers and hymns which would have formed part of the anchoresses' daily routine, is translated or glossed. It appears to have been composed originally for three well-born (<me>gentile</me>) sisters who gave up the world in the flower of their youth to become anchoresses (Nero A. xiv, f. 50, ed. <ref target="#Day-1952">Day 1952</ref>, 80/23-37), and a probably authorial addition to the later form of the work in Corpus 402 addresses a larger and more scattered group of anchoresses, <q>twenty now or more</q> (4. 69r/14); but the internal evidence of the work suggests that from the beginning the author had other possible audiences in mind, not only anchoritic but secular (in the section on confession, Part 5, he tells the anchoresses that most of its material is relevant to everyone, addressing their specific concerns only briefly at the end; and much of the material on the sins in Part 4 is similarly generalized). The accessibility of his work, its vivid, colloquial, and elegant style, and the relevance and interest of its content to a variety of audiences, meant that from a very early stage it began to be revised, adapted, and translated for other kinds of audience, both religious and lay. It survives in seventeen medieval manuscripts and manuscript fragments, and borrowings from it also appear in a number of late-medieval sermons (see <ref target="#Spencer-1993">Spencer 1993</ref>) and devotional works (<ref target="#Millett-1996a">Millett 1996a</ref>; see also <ref target="#Diekstra-1998">Diekstra 1998</ref>).</p> 

<p>It now seems increasingly likely that the origins of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> are Dominican; both its structure and some of its content appear to have been influenced by the early Dominican constitutions, and there are some textual indications that its author itself was a friar (see <ref target="#Millett-1992">Millett 1992</ref>, <ref target="#Millett-2000">Millett 2000</ref>). If so, it must have been written after 1216, when the Dominican order was founded. The revised form of the work in Corpus 402, which refers  approvingly to regular visits to the anchoresses by both Franciscan and Dominican friars, must postdate the arrival of both orders in England (by 1224), and probably their settlement in the West Midlands (by the early 1230s); but since the original version does not mention such visits, and indeed warns the anchoresses not to trust clerical visitors of any kind, it seems likely that it was composed earlier than the 1230s.</p>  

<p>This places <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> in the period following the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, which initiated a major programme of pastoral reform and religious education of the laity across Western Europe. From an early stage, the newly-founded orders of friars were recommended by the Papacy to support local bishops in the implementation of this programme by preaching and hearing confessions. In this period, the West Midlands dioceses of Worcester, Hereford, and Coventry and Lichfield were occupied by a series of reforming bishops (one of whom, Alexander Stavensby, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield 1224-38, had taught Dominic himself at Toulouse, and founded Dominican priories in Shrewsbury and Chester in the 1230s); it is possible that <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> (which includes a substantial proportion of general material on confession), should be seen in this broader context of pastoral reform, as part of a drive to provide a literature of pastoral instruction in the vernacular (see <ref target="#Millett-2003b">Millett 2003b</ref>).</p>
 </div>


<div xml:id="AW-front-intro2" ><head>The Preface to <title>Ancrene Wisse</title></head>

<p>The Preface to <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> is a more complex piece of work than it appears to be at first sight, simultaneously drawing on and reacting against an earlier tradition of monastic legislation.</p>  

<p>Its overall model (see <ref target="#Dobson-1976">Dobson 1976</ref>, Ch. 1), supplying its framework of argument and some of its content, is the prologue first added to the statutes of the Premonstratensian canons when they were revised  c. 1174 (ed. <ref target="#Lefevre-1978">Lefèvre 1978</ref>). The Premonstratensians were one of the independent congregations of Augustinian canons, following the <q>Rule of St. Augustine</q> but supplementing its relatively brief prescriptions with their own more detailed regulations; like the Cistercians, the reformed order of Benedictine monks on whose legislation they initially drew, they were noted for the strict discipline and austerity of their way of life. When St Dominic—who had been an Augustinian canon himself—founded his new order of friars in 1216, and found himself obliged by Canon 13 of the Fourth Lateran Council to accept the rule and regulations of an existing order, he adopted the Premonstratensian regulations (though in a modified form, to fit the very different mission of the Dominicans); it is likely that this is the route by which their prologue, which remained largely unaltered in the early Dominican constitutions (ed. <ref target="#Thomas-1965">Thomas 1965</ref>), reached the author of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title>. The influence of the Premonstratensian/Dominican legislative tradition is also reflected in some of the content of Parts 1 and 8, the <q>Outer Rule</q>, and in the structural subdivision of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> into <lat>distinctiones</lat> and chapters, a feature whose explicit mention here goes back to the original Premonstratensian prologue (which drew attention to a formal innovation, since twelfth-century monastic regulations were normally subdivided only by chapter); see <ref target="#Millett-2002">Millett 2000</ref>, <ref target="#Millett-2003a">Millett 2003a</ref>. 

The Preface goes beyond this model, however, to a critical reassessment of what constitutes the religious life, based on a discussion of some key terms associated with it, <lat>religio</lat> (ME <me>religiun</me>), <lat>ordo</lat> (ME <me>ordre</me>), and <lat>regula</lat> (ME <me>riwle</me>). The author tells us that the anchoresses have repeatedly asked him for a rule, and that they complain that people keep asking them what religious order they belong to. Taken together, these points suggest that they felt a certain unease about their institutional status; and they had some reason, in the early thirteenth century, for feeling marginalized. Lay-anchorites (that is, anchorites who, like these anchoresses, had entered the solitary life from the world rather than from a religious community) counted technically as religious (<lat>religiosi</lat>): they had taken formal vows of chastity, obedience, and stability of abode, and led an enclosed life under the supervision of the local bishop. However, by the early thirteenth century, the term <lat>religio</lat> had come to be used in an increasingly narrow sense; it tended to be applied primarily (as it is in Canon 13 of the Fourth Lateran Council) to the way of life of those belonging to a religious order (<lat>ordo</lat> or, sometimes, <lat>religio</lat>), renouncing personal property, living in an enclosed community, wearing a distinctive habit, and following a written rule (<lat>regula</lat>).  We do not know whether the anchoresses addressed in <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> had turned to the solitary life as their first choice, or whether they had chosen it as an alternative to communal religious life because of the excess of demand over supply in this period for places in women's religious houses; in either case, a central theme of the Preface is the value of forms of religious life other than the traditional monastic model (see <ref target="#Millett-2002">Millett 2002</ref>). The terminology of religious life is reclaimed for extra-monastic forms of vocation, and for the inner, rather than the outer, life: the religious life (<lat>religio</lat> / <lat>ordo</lat>) is redefined, using an unusual allegorization of James 1: 27, in terms of pastoral care and the solitary life rather than monasticism, and the rule (<lat>regula</lat>) that the author offers does not have the legislative status of a traditional monastic rule, but is made up instead of a combination of optional external recommendations (the <q>Outer Rule</q>) and general moral guidance, which the author emphasizes is of divine rather than human origin (the <q>Inner Rule</q>). 

The Preface to <title>Ancrene Wisse</title>, like the work as a whole, reflects an ambivalent attitude to the monastic tradition on which it draws. Although the anchoresses are offered a <q>Rule</q> which owes much to an existing tradition of monastic legislation, the Preface also represents a reaction against traditional monasticism, looking back beyond it to the solitaries of the early Church, and outside it to other kinds of religious life, both in the world and in solitude. Similar attitudes can be found in other writers from the late eleventh to the early thirteenth centuries, reflecting the development of new approaches to the religious life during what has been called the <soCalled>Medieval Reformation</soCalled> (see <ref target="#Bolton-1983">Bolton 1983</ref>). Although Giles Constable saw the essential feature of this movement as <q>the application of the monastic life to all people, and the interiorization of monastic values and spirituality</q> (<ref target="#Constable-1996">Constable 1996</ref>, p. 7), the democratization of monastic ideals seems, in some cases at least, to have been less a process of peaceful dissemination than of active reaction against the identification of <lat>religio</lat> with traditional monasticism. A similar reclamation of the terminology of religious life, in this case for all devout Christians, can be found in the <title>Historia Occidentalis</title> composed in the early 1220s by the reforming preacher James of Vitry: 
<q>We do not consider regulars [<lat>regulares</lat>, i.e. those living according to a rule] only those who renounce the world and go over to a religious life [<lat>religionem</lat>], but we can also describe as regulars all the faithful of Christ who serve the Lord under the rule [<lat>regula</lat>] of the Gospels and who live in an ordered way [<lat>ordinate</lat>: i.e. each following their own <lat>ordo</lat> or vocation] under the one highest and supreme Abbot</q> (Ch. 34, ed. <ref target="#Hinnebusch-1972">Hinnebusch 1972</ref>). 
James's concluding image is paralleled in the later addition to <me>Ancrene Wisse</me> Part 4 mentioned above, where the larger group of anchoresses is described as <q>as if in a cloister over which Jesus is the high Prior</q> (4. 69v); the author of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> offers his readers not a real but a virtual cloister, a <lat>religio</lat> which is a matter of inner disposition rather than outward observance. </p>
 </div>

<div xml:id="AW-front-intro3" ><head>Principles of editing</head>

<p>The existing EETS editions of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> provide a detailed record of the readings of its individual MSS, but are difficult for non-specialists to use. The first aim of this edition is to provide a corrected and fully-annotated working text, based on a good manuscript, for general use; the second is to establish a context for the edited text within the broader historical development of the work.</p>

<p>Ian Doyle noted the <q>exceptionally dynamic character</q> of the textual transmission of Ancrene Wisse (<ref target="#Doyle-1954">Doyle 1954</ref>, i. 234). Between the early thirteenth century and the end of the Middle Ages, the work was repeatedly revised and adapted for different audiences and for different functions; it was also translated once into Latin and twice into French. Some major early revisions were probably authorial. Dobson made a strong case for identifying an early annotator of Cleopatra C.vi (<soCalled>Scribe B</soCalled>, referred to in this edition as <soCalled>C2</soCalled>), who both corrected and revised its carelessly-copied text, with the author himself (<ref target="#Dobson-1976">Dobson 1972</ref>, pp. xciii-cxl). The more extensively revised text in Corpus 402 (A), adapted for a larger group of anchoresses, incorporates both some of the C2 revisions (in some cases further revised) and additional revisions, some shared with other manuscripts, a few unique to A; some at least of these additional revisions are likely to be authorial. However, it is clear that from its earliest stages the work was seen by other users as open to alteration and adaptation, and we cannot assume that all the additions in A were the responsibility of the original author. The internal evidence of a revision (e.g. marked similarities of style and approach to the original, or the use of the first person) may sometimes suggest authorial origin; but these clues are not always present, particularly in shorter additions, and in a social and institutional context where works of popular instruction might be composed, annotated, revised, and sometimes copied, by clerics with relatively similar educational backgrounds, it is not always easy (or even useful) to distinguish between authorial and non-authorial contributions.</p>

<p>Most recent editors of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> have based their editions on A, and it has generally become the standard reference text. There are good reasons for this. Corpus 402 is a carefully-copied, consistently-spelt manuscript, which offers a particularly good text with relatively few errors; it also brings together most (though not all) of the early revisions to the work.</p> 

<p>Dobson argued further for its textual authority as <q>a close copy of the author's own final and definitive revision of his work</q> (<ref target="#Dobson-1962">Dobson 1962</ref>, p. 163). However, there are problems with this view. Although much of the added material in A is likely to be authorial, it is less clear that its text as a whole is the product of direct authorial supervision, or that it constitutes (as has often been assumed) a distinct <soCalled>version</soCalled> of the work. The only part of the work which has been thoroughly overhauled is Part 8; elsewhere, there is less evidence of systematic revision. The significant gap left in the argument by the cutting of an address to the original three anchoresses in Part 4 has not been repaired, and a briefer reference to them in Part 2 remains undeleted; the attribution of more offspring to Envy and Wrath in Part 4 has not been accompanied by a corresponding adjustment to their numbers in the surrounding text; the A text of the long <lat>Quomodo obscuratum</lat> addition in Part 2 is markedly inferior to those in F and V; and some originally marginal annotations have been entered at unsuitable points in the text. The A text seems to be less a <q>coherent and harmonious</q> recasting of the original (to borrow a phrase from Bédier) than the multi-layered product of an ongoing process of textual change; its revisions and deletions reflect a sequence of changing—sometimes even conflicting—intentions, not all of them necessarily authorial.</p>

<p>It can be argued, then, that A is not a definitive authorial version of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title>, or (because of the extensive revisions it incorporates) even a representative form of the work; there is also the problem that its relatively unsystematic incorporation of these revisions does not always make sense in isolation, leaving apparent inconsistencies, discontinuities, or even contradictions in its text. To be understood fully, it needs to be contextualized within the broader textual history of the work, and presented in a way which will make the multi-layered nature of its textual development clearer to the reader.</p>

<p>The editorial approach I have taken does not fit easily into the traditional classifications. This edition is not <soCalled>critical</soCalled> in the traditional sense, although it uses the tools of the critical editor (the analysis of manuscript relationships and of individual variants) to help establish the direction of textual change; it does not attempt to recreate a hypothetical <soCalled>author's original</soCalled> (either of the original work or of a later <soCalled>version</soCalled>), but to provide an edition of a specific historical form of the work, the text in Corpus 402. It is not a <soCalled>best-text</soCalled> edition, since it does not give privileged status to the A text, but uses it rather as a vantage-point from which the early textual development of the work can be retrospectively surveyed. It is not a <soCalled>parallel-text</soCalled> edition (a function already carried out in practice by the EETS series of diplomatic or semi-diplomatic editions of the work); although it prints alongside the text material from other early manuscripts not found in A, it offers a convenient overview of their most significant variations rather than providing full evidence.  It could be described as an attempt to realize in practice the concept of <soCalled>social editing</soCalled> proposed by Jerome J. McGann (see <ref target="#McGann-1992">McGann 1992</ref>), which sees the work not simply in terms of authorial intention, but as a communal product which may be significantly influenced by the broader social context of its production and transmission. My aim has been not, as with traditional textual criticism, to reverse the process of transmission, but to trace its historical development, using the evidence of the manuscript tradition as a whole to remove mechanical errors and misunderstandings from the A text, and to identify and account for other differences between A and the original form of the work.</p>  

<p>The main influences on my editorial conventions have been editions of Latin works showing analogous patterns of continuing textual development: A. H. Thomas's edition of the early Dominican constitutions (<ref target="#Thomas-1965">Thomas 1965</ref>), and David d'Avray's edition of thirteenth-century model sermons on marriage (<ref target="#Avray-2001">d'Avray 2001</ref>), both of which use a combination of typographical mark-up and extended citation of variants to indicate the relationship of their base text to other forms of the work. </p>

<div xml:id="AW-front-intro4" ><head>Methods of editing</head>

<div><head>Text</head> 

<p>The edited text is based on Corpus 402 (A). Alterations by the main scribe have been silently incorporated in the text. Where the text has been emended, the MS reading is given in the Apparatus criticus. Square brackets are used to enclose emendations, and material omitted (for whatever reason) in A which has been been supplied from other MSS.</p> 

<p>Material found in A but not in the original version of <me>Ancrene Wisse</me> is indicated by bold type. My use of bold type to indicate later additions does not distinguish between earlier and later stages of revision (which may sometimes coexist in a single passage), but is simply intended to alert the reader to the presence of changes from the original form of the work; fuller information is given in the Apparatus criticus and the Textual Commentary.</p>

<!-- p>In some cases, the A text appears to incorporate marginal annotations not originally intended for inclusion in the main text (see <ref target="Dobson-1962">Dobson 1962</ref>, pp. 157-8); these have been left at the point at which they appear in the A text, but are indicated by smaller type (unless they have been <q>adopted</q> into the main text by subsequent rewriting and/or the provision of a translation).</p-->

<p>Rubrics in A are indicated by red type. Rubrics in MSS other than A are not recorded in the footnotes or Apparatus criticus unless there is a corresponding rubric in A, though they may be commented on in the Textual Commentary (for a discussion of possibly authorial rubrics in the early MSS and in F not found in A, see <ref target="#Dobson-1972">Dobson 1972</ref>, pp. lvi-lxii).</p>

<p>Abbreviations are silently expanded, and capitalization, punctuation, and paragraphing modernized. Word-division has been standardized, and in most cases modernized. The accent-like hairlines sometimes used by the A scribe above vowels (see Ker in <ref target="#Tolkien-1962">Tolkien 1962</ref>, p. xiii) are not reproduced.</p>

<p>For the Middle English, I have followed the spelling of A, unless it is clearly erroneous by the scribe's normal standards. Words or short passages incorporated into the text from other MSS are normally silently adapted to A's spelling-conventions; where longer passages from other MSS are used to supply gaps in A, the spelling of the alternative base MS is retained. The spelling of the Latin in A is retained.</p>

<p>On the line-numbering and paragraph-numbering used in the text, see the Editor's Preface, under <q>Problems</q>. Also incorporated in the text are folio-references to the base MS, Corpus 402.</p> </div>


<div><head>Footnotes</head>

<p>The footnotes are used to present separately, with a translation, material from the original version of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title>, and from the earlier stages of its textual development, either not found, or found in altered form, in A. Normally only the more substantial variants (i.e., more than a few words long) are included; shorter ones are recorded only in the apparatus criticus, unless they change the meaning of a larger unit of text.</p>  </div>

<div><head>Apparatus criticus</head>

<p>The Apparatus criticus is selective. Variations in spelling, and variations in word-form which do not affect the sense, are not normally cited, unless the variant is ambiguous or helps to cast light on other MS readings. Variations between <me>þe</me> and <me>þet</me> (both as demonstrative adjective and as relative pronoun) are not cited. As a rule, only those variants are cited which are shared by more than one MS (though single-MS variants may be cited where they are related to a preceding or following variant shared by more than one MS, or where they are of interest in themselves).</p>

<p>Variants are recorded more fully from CFGNTV than from the rewritten versions LPSR (for the MSS and their sigla, see the following section of the Introduction, <q>About the manuscripts</q>). The revisions made by C2 to C are recorded (except where they do no more than correct errors in C, or modify its spelling and punctuation); also the alterations to adjust the work to a different audience found in two of the early MSS, G and T. Modernizations of vocabulary and word-order, and minor verbal expansions which add nothing to the sense, are not normally recorded.</p>

<p>Lemmata are from the A text unless otherwise indicated; where a different base MS is being used, the MS sigil is given before the line-number. If the word in a lemma occurs more than once in the line, the particular instance is identified by number.</p>

<p>The form of a variant given in the Apparatus criticus is that of the first MS listed; the readings of the French and Latin versions are not given separately where it is clear that they are translating one particular variant in the English. Variants are normally cited in alphabetical order of sigil; but this order may be departed from to group variants according to their distance from the lemma, to put the English form of a variant before the French and Latin, and (occasionally) to avoid citing a variant in an anomalous form. It should not be assumed that all MSS not cited support the reading of the lemma; fuller variants, however, are cited where the reading in A is not shared by the other MSS, has only minority support, or is otherwise problematic. Where supporting evidence for the A reading is given, any MS not cited is either temporarily not running or casts no light on the variants in question (e.g. where the French and Latin versions could be translating either of two English synonyms).</p>

<p>Abbreviations are silently expanded, and capitalization, punctuation, word-division, and paragraphing are modernized; where any of these are relevant to the reading, however, they are discussed in the Textual Commentary.</p></div>

<p>117 parchment leaves. Two leaves (the central opening of the second quire) missing after f. 14. 215 x 148 mm. (after rebinding); written space c. 156 x 95 mm. (ff. 1-68), 156 x
100 (ff. 69-117), single column of 28 lines. Coloured initials and paragraph-marks (red and blue). Carefully written in a smaller Gothic book hand, dated by Ker, <ref target="#Tolkien-1962">Tolkien 1962</ref>, p. xv) to the first half of the thirteenth century. Dialect localized by Jeremy Smith to northern Herefordshire or southern Shropshire (see <ref target="#Millett-1996a">Millett 1996a)</ref>, p. 11, fn. 7). In the bottom margin of f. 1v, an <lat>ex libris</lat> inscription added towards the end of the thirteenth century records the gift of the MS by John Purcel (a Shropshire landowner) to the house of
Victorine canons at Wigmore Abbey in Herefordshire, at the request of its precentor, Walter of Ludlow (see Ker, <ref target="#Tolkien-1962">Tolkien 1962</ref>, pp. xvii-xviii). The MS includes minor corrections, alterations, and marginalia in hands of the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries; further annotations were added in the sixteenth century, when it was owned by Archbishop Parker. On Parker's death in 1575 it passed to Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge.</p>
<p>The text of Corpus 402 is generally of high quality, though not free of errors (mainly
of omission). It reflects a major (though not comprehensive)overhaul of the work for a changed audience, the group of twenty or more anchoresses addressed in a unique addition in Part 4 (ff. 69r/12--69v/11), now apparently regularly visited by the friars (ff. 16v/13-17r/2, 112v/10-14). It brings together most of the early revisions and additions found elsewhere in the MS tradition, sometimes developing them further, and also includes some added material not found elsewhere.  The main alterations to the text, much of which remains largely untouched, are in Parts 2, 4, and 8. Part 4 includes an expanded account of the offspring of the Seven Deadly Sins (apparently based on an earlier stage of
revision) and some direct addresses to the larger group of anchoresses (found only in A); there are also three substantial additions (shared with <ref target="#AW-MS-F">F</ref>, and in one case <ref target="#AW-MS-V">V</ref> as well) in Part 2. Part 8, the most thoroughly worked-over section, takes further the revisions to the <q>Outer Rule</q> found in
the C2 annotations of <ref target="#AW-MS-C">MS C</ref>, possibly again building on an intermediate stage of revision. </p>

<p>203 parchment leaves; text of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> ff. 4r-198v. One leaf missing between f. 190 and f. 191. 194 x 140 mm.; written space 56-72 mm. wide, 114-142 mm. long, single column of 18-28 lines (<ref target="#Dobson-1972">Dobson 1972</ref>, xxix-xlvi, explains these variations by the initial influence of an exemplar in <q>a smaller, more compact hand</q> than the scribe's own; their pattern, together with some irregularities in quiring and in the continuity of the copying, indicates that the scribe copied his exemplar in six sections, some out of sequence, suggesting that <q>some form of the <lat>pecia</lat> system was in use</q>). Coloured initials and paragraph-marks (red and blue). Not very carefully written in a smaller Gothic book hand, dated by <ref target="#Ker-1964">Ker 1964</ref>, p. 29, to the first half of the thirteenth century. Dialect of main scribe localized by Jeremy Smith to North Worcestershire (see <ref target="#Laing-1993">Laing
1993</ref>, pp. 74-75). An inscription (<lat>c.</lat> 1300) on f. 3r records the gift
of the MS to the house of Augustinian canonesses at Canonsleigh in Devon by Matilda de Clare, Countess of Gloucester; it was later owned by Robert Talbot (d. 1558), prebendary of Norwich, before its acquisition by Sir Robert Cotton.</p>
<p>The MS, whose text is flawed by errors, frequent small-scale omissions, and arbitrary rephrasing, has been extensively corrected and revised, mainly by two scribes, C2 and C3
(Dobson's <q>Scribe B</q> and <q>Scribe D</q>). C2, plausibly identified by <ref target="#Dobson-1972">Dobson 1972</ref>, xciii-cxl, with the author of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title>, appears to have worked on the MS before it was bound; he corrects many of C's misreadings and rewritings, also adding clarifications of difficulties and a number of revisions, reflecting an earlier stage of some of the revisions found in <ref target="#AW-MS-A">MS A (Corpus 402)</ref>. The late-thirteenth-century scribe C3, working at Canonsleigh, added further corrections and annotations; <ref target="#Dobson-1972">Dobson 1972</ref>, cxlvii-cxlviii, argues that he was an Augustinian canon, but the evidence cited suggests rather that he was a
Dominican (he copies out a Dominican prayer for preachers on f. 198v, and his familiarity with the Rule of St Augustine need not indicate an Augustinian connection, since the Dominicans also followed this Rule).</p>

<p>The version of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> in P has been extensively abridged,
rewritten, and interpolated; it addresses a general audience of both sexes, and often works against the sense of the original, celebrating the active rather than the contemplative life. <ref target="#Colledge-1939">Colledge 1939</ref> identifies two stages of reworking, the first by a Lollard reviser (though recent research suggests that the revisions may be too early to be <soCalled>Lollard</soCalled>), the second by the Pepys scribe himself. The text of P is extraordinarily garbled, probably through a combination of its remoteness from the original and the scribe's inability to cope adequately either with Latin or with the <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> author's difficult Middle English; but its textual history, which reflects an earlier stage of the process of revision seen in <ref target="#AW-MS-A">MS

<p>A very large, handsomely-illuminated anthology of religious and moral literature, mainly in Middle English, compiled in the West Midlands probably towards the end of the C14; its exact date, place of origin, patron(s) and intended audience are uncertain.  Internal
evidence places it after 1384; dialectal and other evidence links it with the area including S. Staffordshire, N.  Worcestershire, and W. Warwickshire. <ref target="#Doyle-1987">Doyle 1987</ref> suggests tentatively that its production may have been initiated by the Cistercian abbey at Bordesley, N. Worcestershire, for the house of
nuns at Nuneaton, Shropshire; though an audience of pious laity cannot be ruled out. The text of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> (called in the medieval list of contents
<title level="a">Roule of Reclous</title>) is on ff. 371vb--392ra, preceded by <title>A Talkyng of the Loue of God</title> (which draws on two <soCalled>Wooing Group</soCalled> works, <title>The Wohunge of ure Lauerd</title> and <title>On Ureisun of ure Louerde</title>). Three folios (389-391) are missing from the text, which lacks the
later part of Part 6 (from <me>heaued</me>, Corpus 402, f. 97v/18), all of Part 7, and most of Part 8, from which only two sections survive, part of the addition on wimples and the paragraph warning against idleness (<ref target="#Zettersten-2000">Zettersten and
Diensberg 2000</ref>, 128/26--129/12).</p>

<p>350 parchment leaves (originally probably 422 or 426), 544 x 393 mm. Written space in Section IV (ff. 319-406) <lat>c.</lat> 412-20 x 284-94 mm.; two columns of 80 lines, 132-7 mm. across; illuminated initials, coloured paragraph-marks (red and blue).  Text
of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> written by the second Vernon scribe, <soCalled>Scribe B</soCalled>, in Anglicana Formata.  In spite of its late date, the Vernon text of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> is of relatively high quality, with only minor modifications (mainly
modernizations of vocabulary). For the main body of the text, its closest affinities are with <ref target="#AW-MS-N">MS N</ref> and (where it is running) <ref target="#AW-MS-G">G</ref>, but it also incorporates a number of the revisions found in <ref target="#AW-MS-A">MS A</ref>.</p></div></div></div>

<p><pp target="#P1"/>  <label>P.[3]</label><lat>Recti diligunt te</lat>: three kinds of <q>rightness</q>, grammatical, geometrical, theological, the third comprising two
rules, directing inner disposition and external conduct.</p>

<p><pp target="#P2"/> <label>P.[3]-7</label>The author will discuss these rules, since
his <q>dear sisters</q> have long been requesting a rule.</p>

<p><pp target="#P3"/> <label>P.8-11</label>The first is charity, which rules the heart.</p>

<p><pp target="#P4"/> <label>P.12-15</label>The second, which is subordinate, regulates outward observances.</p>

<p><pp target="#P5"/> <label>P. 16-34</label>The inner rule, which is divinely ordained, is the same for all; but the corporal observances of the outer rule may be adapted for individual anchoresses on their confessor's advice.</p>

<p><pp target="#P6"/> <label>P. 35-55</label>They should commit themselves by a vow only to obedience, chastity, and stability of abode, not to any external observances.</p>

<p><pp target="#P7"/> <label>P. 56-94</label>If asked what order they belong to, and whether it is black or white, they should say <q>the order of St James</q>; the author interprets the definition of the religious life (<lat>religio</lat>) in Jas. 1: 27 as including
prelates and preachers in the world as well as those who withdraw themselves from it, and emphasises that James makes no mention of black or white clothing. <lat>Religio</lat> is a matter of inner disposition, not outward attire, and although a uniform habit may
serve to reflect the inner unity of religious communities, it is unnecessary for recluses.</p>

<p><pp target="#P8"/> <label>P. 96-116</label><title>Ancrene Wisse</title> is divided into eight parts (<lat>distinctiones</lat>): i) devotions ii) the custody of the senses
iii) a comparison of recluses to birds based on Ps. 101: 7 iv)
   temptation v) confession vi) penance vii) purity of heart and the
   love of Christ viii) the outer rule.</p>  </body>

<p rend="rubric">In
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, the
<title>Guide for Anchoresses</title> begins here.
   </p>
<p n="1" rend="it"><q>The
upright love you.</q> In the Song of Songs: the bride to the bridegroom. There is what is right in grammar, what is right in geometry, and what is right in theology; and each of these is a different kind of rightness. We are talking about rightness in a
theological sense, which has two rules: one is concerned with the
direction of the heart, the other with the rectification of
external things.</p>

<p n="2"><hi rend="it">The upright love you.</hi> <q>Lord</q>, says the bride of God to
her beloved bridegroom, <q>the upright love you.</q> The upright are
those who live according to a rule.  And you, my dear sisters, have
been asking me for a long time for a rule. There are many kinds of
rule; but there are two in particular that I will discuss because of
your request, with the grace of God.</p>

<p n="3">One of them rules the heart, and makes it even and smooth
without the bumps and hollows of a crooked and accusing conscience
which says, <q>You are committing a sin here</q>, or <q>This is not
yet atoned for as well as it ought to be.</q> This rule is always
internal and directs the heart. <hi rend="it">And this is the charity which the
Apostle describes, <q>of a pure heart and a clear conscience and
sincere faith</q>.</hi> This rule is the charity of a pure heart and a
clear conscience and true faith. <hi rend="bi">Extend your mercy, says the
Psalmist, to those who know you by sincere faith, and your
justice—that is, uprightness of life—to those who have an
upright heart—that is, those who direct all their intentions
according to the rule of the divine will. These people are called
the good <fr>par excellence</fr>: the Psalmist says: Do good, O Lord,
to those who are good and upright in heart. They are told that
they should rejoice—that is, in the testimony of a clear conscience:
Rejoice, all you who are upright in heart, that is, those who
have been set right by that supreme rule which rectifies everything,
of which Augustine says, Nothing should be sought after but the
rule of the supreme authority, and the Apostle, Let us all
remain in the same rule.</hi></p>

<p n="4">The second rule is completely external and regulates the body
and physical acts, giving directions on all outward behaviour, how you
should eat, drink, dress, say your prayers, sleep, keep vigil. <hi rend="bi">And this is bodily exercise, which according to the Apostle
is worth little; and is like the rule of what is right in mechanics,
which is part of the discipline of geometry</hi>.  And this rule only
exists to serve the other. The other is like the lady, this one like
her maid; because all that is ever done according to the outer rule is
only to regulate the heart internally.
      </p>

<p n="5">Now you ask what rule you anchoresses should observe. You
should in every way, with all your might, scrupulously observe the
inner rule, and the outer for the sake of the inner. The inner rule is
always the same, the outer varies; because everyone should observe the
outer rule in the way that helps her best to follow the inner.  Now,
it is indeed the case that all anchoresses can observe a single rule
<hi rend="it">as far as purity of heart is concerned, which is the objective of all
religious life</hi>; that is, everyone can and should observe one rule
concerning purity of heart, which is a clean and clear understanding
(<hi rend="bi">conscience</hi>) unaware of any sin which has not been amended through confession. This is the work of the lady rule, which rules and straightens and smooths away sin from the heart and the conscience;
because nothing makes it crooked apart from sin. Straightening and
smoothing it is the virtue and the whole strength of every religious
way of life and of every order. This rule is not a product of human
invention, but of divine precept; therefore it is eternally
unchanging, and everyone should observe it always in the same way. But
not everyone can observe a single rule, and they need not and should
not observe the outer rule in the same way, <hi rend="it">that is, where corporal
observances are concerned</hi>: that is, corporal observances according to
the outer rule, which I called the maid, and which is a human
invention, established for no other reason than to serve the inner,
which makes people fast, keep vigil, wear scanty and rough clothing,
and similar hardships, which many can stand physically, many
cannot. Therefore the latter must be changed in various ways according
to each individual's nature and her capacity. For one may be robust,
another so delicate that she can reasonably be excused and please God
with less. One may be well-educated, another who is not must do more
manual labour and say her prayers differently. One may be old and
unprepossessing and give less cause for anxiety, another may be young
and beautiful and need to be guarded more carefully. For this reason
every anchoress should keep the outer rule according to her
confessor's advice, and whatever he asks and orders her to do in
obedience, being familiar with her nature and knowing her strength. He
can change the outer rule at his discretion, according to how he sees
that the inner rule can best be observed.
      </p>

<p n="6">My advice is that no anchoress should make profession—that
is, bind herself to a vow—of more than three things, which are
obedience, chastity, and stability of abode (that she should never
move elsewhere afterwards unless it is absolutely necessary, as in the
case of violence and fear of death, or obedience to her bishop or his
superior). For whoever undertakes something and promises God to carry
it out as a vow binds herself to it, and commits a mortal sin if she
voluntarily breaks her vow. If she does not promise it, she may do it
nevertheless, and give it up whenever she wants to—as with food,
with drink, abstaining from meat or fish, and everything of that kind,
with dress, with sleeping arrangements, with Hours, with other
prayers, saying so many or in such a way. You are free to do or to
give up all these things and others like them while you want and when
you want unless they have been vowed. But charity, which is love, and
humility and patience, faithfulness and keeping all the ten
commandments, confession and penance, these and others like them, some
of which belong to the old law, some to the new, are not human
inventions or a rule established by man, but are God's commands, and
therefore everyone is obliged to keep them, and you above all, because
these rule the heart. Nearly everything that I write is about ruling
the heart, except at the beginning of this book and at the very
end. You already observe everything of the outer rule that I am
writing about here, my dear sisters, thanks be to God, and through his
grace will do so the longer the better. But even so, I do not want you
to bind yourselves by a vow to observe them; because as often as you
broke any of them after that, it would distress you too much and make
you so anxious that you might soon—which God forbid!—fall into
despair, that is, into an absence of hope and a loss of faith in your
salvation. For this reason, my dear sisters, you should not make a vow
to practise anything that I write for you about external observances
in the first part of your book, on devotions, and more particularly in
the last, but keep it in your heart and practise it as if you had made
a vow.
      </p>

<p n="7">If any ignorant person asks you what order you belong to—as
you tell me some do, straining out the gnat and swallowing the
fly—answer: of St James, who was God's apostle and called God's
brother because of his great holiness. If such an answer seems strange
and remarkable to him, ask him what constitutes order, and where he
could find the religious way of life more clearly described and
explained in Holy Scripture than it is in St James's canonical
epistle. He defines religious life and true order. <hi rend="it">Pure and immaculate
religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and
widows in their need, and to keep oneself unspotted from this world</hi>;
that is, <q>Pure and immaculate religion is to visit and help widows
and fatherless children, and keep oneself pure and unspotted from the
world.</q> This is how St James describes religious life and
order. The second part of what he says applies to recluses; because
there are two parts, corresponding to the two different kinds of
religious. Each kind has its own part, as you may hear. Some people in
the world are good religious, especially prelates and true
preachers. The first part of what St James said applies to them; they
are, as he says, those who go to help widows and fatherless
children. The soul is a widow who has lost her spouse, that is, Jesus
Christ, through any mortal sin. Those are also fatherless who through
their sin have lost the Father of heaven. Going to see such people and
comforting them and helping them with the nourishment of holy
instruction—this is true religion, says St James. The second part
of what he says applies to your kind of religious life, as I said
before, keeping yourselves pure and unspotted from the world more than
other religious. So the apostle St James, describing religion,
mentions neither white nor black—in his order. But many people strain
out the gnat and swallow the fly—that is, attach great importance to
what matters least. Paul the First Hermit, Antony and Arsenius,
Macarius and the others, weren't they religious and of St James's
order? Likewise St Sarah and St Syncletica, and many others like them,
both men and women, with their coarse mats and their harsh
hair-shirts; didn't they belong to a good order? And whether white or
black—as ignorant people ask you, thinking that order consists in
the outer garment—God knows; nevertheless, they were certainly both,
not, however, in their clothes, but as God's spouse sings of herself,
<hi rend="it">I am black but comely</hi>. <q>I am black and yet white</q>, she says:
unsightly outside, bright inside. This is how you should answer those
people who ask about your order, and whether it is white or black: say
that you are both through the grace of God, and of the order of St
James which he described next: <hi>To keep oneself unspotted from this
world</hi>—that is, as I said before, to keep oneself pure and unspotted
from the world. This is what the religious life consists in, not in
the wide hood or the black cape, or in the white rochet or in the grey
cowl. Where many people are gathered together, for the sake of unity
importance must be attached to uniformity of clothing, and of other
kinds of external observances, so that the outer uniformity should
symbolize the inner unity of one love and one will that they all have
in common.  With their uniform habit, which they all share, and also
in other things, they proclaim that all of them together share one
love and one will (take care that they are not lying!). That is the
nature of a community. But wherever a woman or a man is living on
their own, as a hermit or recluse, it does not matter much about
external things as long as they do not give rise to scandal.  Listen
to Micah: <hi rend="it">I will show you, O man, what is good and what God requires
from you: to judge rightly at all costs and walk carefully with the
Lord your God</hi>. <q>I will show you, O man,</q> says the holy Micah,
God's prophet, <q>I will show you truly what is good, and the nature
of religion and order, the kind of holiness God requires from you.</q>
It is this; understand it. <q>Always do well and deem yourself weak,
and with dread and with love walk with God your Lord.</q> Where these
things are, there is true religious life, there is true order; and to
do all the rest and neglect this is nothing but fraud and
hypocrisy. <hi rend="bi">Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, who clean
the outside of the cup and plate, but inside are full of every kind of
uncleanness, like whited sepulchres</hi>. All that good religious do or
wear according to the outer rule is entirely for this purpose; it is
nothing more than than a tool with which to build towards it, nothing
more than a maid to serve the lady in ruling the heart.
   </p>


<p n="8"><title rend="rubric">This
one book is divided into eight smaller books.</title>
 Now, my dear sisters, I am dividing
this book into eight <q>distinctions</q>, which you call parts; and
each one deals with its own particular topics, without overlap,
and nevertheless each follows on logically from the one before,
and what comes later is always linked to what precedes.
<list type="plain">
<item>The first part is all about your devotions.</item>
<item>The second is about how you should use your five senses to guard
your heart, in which are order and religion and the life of the
soul. In this distinction there are five chapters, that is, five
sections corresponding to the five senses, which guard the heart
like watchmen wherever they are faithful; and it says something
about each one separately in turn.</item>
<item>The third part is about birds of a particular kind which David
compares himself to in the Psalter as if he were a recluse, and
how recluses are similar in nature to those birds.</item>
<item>The fourth part is about both carnal and spiritual temptations,
and comfort against them, and about their remedies.</item>
<item>The fifth part is about confession.</item>
<item>The sixth part is about penance.</item>
<item>The seventh, about purity of heart, why Jesus Christ should and
must be loved, and what deprives us of his love and prevents us
from loving him.</item>
<item>The eighth part is all about the outer rule: first about food and
drink, and other related matters; then about the things you are
allowed to receive, and what things you are allowed to guard or
keep; then about your clothes and related matters; then about your
handiwork; about haircutting and bloodletting; about your maids'
rule; finally, how you should teach them lovingly.</item></list>

     <div rend="nosplit" xml:id="AW-MSS-trans" ><head>About the transcriptions</head>

<p>The transcriptions have been redone from the manuscripts, using the <ref target="#AW-MSS-conv">conventions</ref> listed below, but are heavily indebted to the existing transcriptions in the EETS diplomatic editions by <ref target="#Tolkien-1962">Tolkien 1962</ref> (Corpus 402), <ref target="#Dobson-1972">Dobson 1972</ref> (Cleopatra C. vi) and <ref target="#Day-1952">Day 1952</ref> (Nero A.xiv).</p>

<p>The notes on the transcription of Cleopatra C.vi, whose text was
  extensively worked over by two later annotators, C2 (Dobson's
  <soCalled>Scribe B</soCalled>, possibly the author of <title>Ancrene
   Wisse</title>) and the late-C13 C3 (Dobson's <soCalled>Scribe
   D</soCalled>) are not comprehensive; in particular, the numerous
  alterations to MS punctuation by both scribes are not
  recorded. Interested readers are recommended to check Dobson's much
  fuller and more analytical annotations.</p>


 </div>
<div rend="nosplit" xml:id="AW-MSS-conv" ><head>Conventions of transcription</head>

<p>These conventions draw (with some minor modifications) on the current general EETS guidelines (<title level="a">Notes for Editors</title>, 1994), and on the conventions observed in earlier EETS editions of <title>Ancrene Wisse</title> manuscripts.
<list type="ordered">
<item>Transcriptions should be unemended (though damaged or missing letters may be supplied); notes on scribal errors and problematic readings may be provided at the editor's discretion.
</item>
<item>
Abbreviations (including the Tironian nota for <q>and</q>, and the abbreviation of <q>that</q> by thorn with a crossbar through the ascender) should be expanded, and the expansion indicated by italics. <q>Otiose strokes</q> in C15 MSS  should not be reproduced if they fall in the middle of a word, but should be indicated by an apostrophe if they occur finally.
    </item><item>
<q>Manuscript use of <q>u</q> and <q>v</q> and of <q>i</q> and <q>j</q> should be preserved. Ambiguous letters, such as <q>y</q> / <q>thorn</q> or <q>yogh</q> / <q>z</q> in some manuscripts, should be interpreted according to their phonetic intentions and exceptional cases explained in the prefatory note</q> (<q>Notes for Editors</q>).
Initial <q>ff</q> should be represented as <q>F</q>. <q>Wyn</q> should be displayed as w (though its presence can be recorded in the XML mark-up if required); the special characters <q>eth</q>, <q>thorn</q>, and <q>yogh</q> should be both recorded in the XML mark-up and displayed where this is practically possible, though alternate
characters may be displayed if necessary. This on-line edition, for the reasons given in the Editor's Preface, replaces lower-case <q>yogh</q> by the numeral <q>3</q>, and upper-case <q>yogh</q> by <q>3</q> underlined.
    </item>

<item>MS punctuation should be recorded in the mark-up. Where the punctuation
cannot be displayed on-screen, alternate characters may have to be used. In this on-line edition, the full stop is used to render the <lat>punctus</lat>, the semicolon for the <lat>punctus elevatus</lat>, and the question-mark for the <lat>punctus interrogativus</lat>. <emph>NB</emph> this is <hi>not</hi> a modernization of punctuation but a substitution of characters; the modern symbols in the transcription should be understood as having the function of the medieval characters they replace.
</item>

<item>Where letters have been wholly or partially lost, through deliberate deletion or accidental damage, they are placed within square brackets; those which can be reconstructed are in Roman type, those which have not survived but can be supplied in italics.
    </item>

<item>Manuscript punctuation and capitalization are retained. However, word-division is modernized, to facilitate tagging and searching. For the same reason, unhyphenated word-breaks across lines are indicated by an = sign in the transcription.  Where a compound
word is hyphenated in the edited text, it is treated as a single word in the transcription.
</item><item>
Marginal and interlinear additions attributed to the original scribe should be enclosed in the text by a backward and forward slash \   /. Those by later scribes should be indicated in the footnotes. There should be no repetition of note-numbers (i.e. no use of <q>fn1</q> at several different points in the text to refer back to the same footnote). Footnote-numbering should be continuous (though this
may only be by section, if the work is long).
    </item><item>
Deletions attributed to the original scribe, whether by crossing-out
    or by expunction, should be indicated by angle brackets &lt;  &gt;
<!-- del> </del-->.
    </item><item>
Coloured initial letters should be represented by red type; size can be indicated, if required, in a footnote.
    </item><item>
Where possible, the lineation of the MS should be preserved for easier comparison with MS images; line-numbering should start again with each MS page.
    </item></list></p></div>

<me>wisse</me> (probably from the OE verb <oe>wissian</oe> 'rule',

<note xml:id="N3" n="(1r/1-1v/11)" target="#P1"> <label>Recti
. . . withinnen</label>: The word-play in the Latin parts of this
passage on <lat>rectum</lat>, <lat>directio</lat>,
<lat>rectificatio</lat>, and <lat>regula</lat> cannot be fully
reproduced in MnE, but the phonetic as well as etymological link
between ME <me>riht</me>, <me>rihten</me>, <me>riwle</me>, and
<me>riwlin</me>, and their relatively wide semantic range, meant that
much of it could be reflected in ME. Its ultimate source, quoted in S,
is Isidore of Seville's <title>Etymologiae</title>, Bk. 6, Ch. 16, §
1, <ref target="#Lindsay-1911">Lindsay 1911</ref>, vol. 1, <lat>Regula
autem dicta quod recte ducit . . . Alii dixerunt regulam dictam vel
quod regat, vel quod normam recte vivendi praebeat, vel quod distortum
pravumque quid corrigat</lat> (<q>It is called a rule because it leads
rightly . . . Others have said that it is called a rule because it
rules, or because it offers a standard for living rightly, or because
it corrects something which is crooked and wrong</q>), which is
carried over into the twelfth- and thirteenth-century tradition of
commentary on the Augustinian Rule. Lietbert of St Ruf echoes it in
his twelfth-century <title>Expositio in regulam beati
Augustini</title>, Ch. 1, <title>PL</title> 176. 881, and Adam of
Dryburgh develops it more fully in his <title>De ordine, habitu et
professione canonicorum ordinis Praemonstratensis</title> (before
1178), <title>Sermo</title> 1, <title>PL</title> 198. 446-8, citing
S. of S. 1: 3 (446) and Ps. 31: 11 (447), asking <lat>Quis rectus,
nisi qui regularis est?</lat> (<q>Who is upright but the one who lives
according to a rule?</q>, 447) and contrasting the <lat>recti
corde</lat> (<q>upright in heart</q>) with those who are
<lat>curvati</lat> (<q>bowed down</q>) through love of carnal
things. The Dominican Humbert of Romans in his mid-thirteenth-century
commentary makes the underlying imagery here more explicit:
<lat>Dicitur hoc opus regula dupliciter: regula enim uno modo dicitur
a rectitudine, quasi rectula, sicut est illa, quam utuntur scriptores,
et lignarii, et cementarii; alio modo dicitur a regendo, ut in
grammatica, et in aliis scientiis; iuxta primum modum dicitur hoc opus
regula, quia sicut per regulam distorta diriguntur, sic per hoc opus
distortae vitae diriguntur; item, sicut per illam gibbi removentur, ut
patet in cementario, sic per istam superbiae et superfluitates
complanantur ... secundo etiam modo potest dici regula, quia sicut
regula in sanctis</lat> [sic, for <lat>scolis</lat>?] <lat>docet artem
sciendi, sic istud opus artem vivendi . . .</lat> (<q>This work is
called a <quote>rule</quote> in two senses: for in one sense it is so
called from its straightness, as if it were a ruler of the kind used
by scribes, carpenters, and bricklayers; in another it is so called
from <quote>laying down rules</quote>, as in grammar and in other
disciplines. According to the first sense this work is called a rule
because just as crooked things are straightened by a ruler, so crooked
lives are directed by this work; and again, as bumps are removed by
it, as can be seen in the case of a bricklayer, so also the excesses
of pride are smoothed out . . . and it can be called a rule in the
second sense, because as a rule in the schools teaches the art of
learning, so this work teaches the art of living . . .</q>)

<note xml:id="N4" n="(1r/1-9)" target="#P1"><label>Recti . . . rectificationem</label>:  this Latin passage is found in all MSS running, but is translated only in S; the author seems (as 
<ref target="#Savage-1991">Savage and Watson 1991</ref>, p. 340, note) to be addressing
academically-trained readers—perhaps the spiritual directors who would use the work—rather than his audience of recluses, and its references to different academic disciplines are not picked up in the English passage that follows. It is possible that it was intended not as part of the main text, but as an introductory note.

Matt. 23: 24, a text also invoked (as noted by <ref target="#Allen-1918">Allen 1918</ref>, p. 522), in the twelfth-century debate between the Cistercians and the Cluniacs on the colour of their habits; see note on <ref target="#N59" n="3r/28--3v/3">P. 71-73 (3r/28-3v/3</ref>). L adds the scriptural reference, and has <lat>camelum</lat> rather than <me>flehe</me>; but while it is likely that the author had this verse in mind (cf. note on <ref target="#N75" n="4r/12-14">P. 93 (4r/12-14)</ref>), all other MSS running have <q>fly</q> (except P, which has nonsense based on it, <me>Þe gnatte foloweþ þe flesche</me>), which suggests a deliberate domestication of the image. </note>

<note xml:id="N51" n="P. 57-58 (3r/3)" target="#P7"><label>for . . . broðer</label>: the Scriptural description of James as the brother of Christ raised theological problems if taken literally; it was either interpreted more loosely (see <title>ODCC</title> <lat>s.</lat> <q>brethren of the Lord</q>) or, as here, explained figuratively. Both interpretations can be found in Jerome's discussion of Gal. 1: 19, <title>Commentarii in Epistolam ad Galatas</title>, <title>PL</title> 26. 330. </note>

<note xml:id="N52" n="P. 59-60 (3r/6)" target="#P7"><label>openluker . . . þen</label>: The pattern of MS readings suggests that the mixed construction in A, <me>openlukest . . . þen</me>, was in their common original; but also that the scribes and translators were generally unhappy with it, and attempted to resolve it either by changing the superlative to a comparative, or by substituting <q>that</q> for <q>than</q> to begin a new sentence. C2, correcting
C by inserting the omitted word <me>religiun</me> after <me>openlukest</me>, lets the latter solution stand, but this could be the result of his policy of minimal textual alteration (see <ref target="#Dobson-1972">Dobson 1972</ref>, p. cxii); the former solution makes better sense in context. It is possible that <me>openlukest</me> was a
short-sighted scribal alteration encouraged by the distance between <me>openluker</me> and its corresponding <me>þen</me>. </note>

<note xml:id="N56" n="P. 62-71 (3r/13-27)" target="#P7"><label>þus . . . unwemmet</label>: the interpretation here is a departure from the traditional exegesis of Jas. 1: 27; see <ref target="#Millett-2002">Millett 2002</ref>. The standard medieval interpretation goes back to Bede, who saw it as defining the two basic obligations of the active life (as led by all Christians, including monks), <lat>misericordia</lat> (compassion towards one's neighbour) and <lat>innocentia</lat> (the avoidance of sin); see <title>De Tabernaculo</title>, Bk. 1, Ch. 6, <title>CCSL</title> 119A. 21. In the twelfth century, the first part of the verse was sometimes applied by regular canons to the duty of pastors to
protect their flock against oppression, and the second by monks to literal withdrawal from the world, but there seem to be no earlier parallels with the <title>AW</title> author's identification of the two parts of the verse with two different ways of life, active and
contemplative, followed by different categories of people (on the development of this distinction, see <ref target="#Constable-1995">Constable 1995</ref>, Part 1), or with his identification of James's <q>widows and orphans</q> with souls in need of instruction, a reading probably borrowed from Jerome's interpretation of two other Scriptural texts which mention widows and orphans, Ps. 145: 9 (<title>Tractatus de psalmo 145</title>, <title>CCSL</title> 78. 328) and Isa. 10: 2 (<title>Commentarii in Isaiam</title>, Bk. 4, <title>PL</title> 24. 133). The author's application of the passage on the one hand to those active in the world, <q>especially prelates and true preachers</q> (see note on <ref target="#N56" n="3r/17">P. 65 (3r/17)</ref>), and on the other to anchoresses <q>more than other religious</q> emphasizes the value of their way of life at the expense of <lat>religio</lat> as more narrowly defined by Canon 13 of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 (<title>Conc. oec. decreta</title>, p. 242), membership of a religious order. It is not
clear what the translator of F has in mind in mentioning female as well as male religious in the world; P, still more puzzlingly, mentions <me>two manere of wymmen þat ben trewe prelates and prechoures</me>. </note>

<note xml:id="N57" n="P. 65 (3r/17)" target="#P7"><label>prelaz ant treowe preachurs</label>: it is probable that the reference here is (at least primarily) to secular clerics; although both monks
(if they were ordained) and regular canons might preach publicly and serve as <lat>praelati</lat> in the world (see <ref target="#Hourlier-1974">Hourlier 1974</ref>, pp. 272-3, 471-84) the traditional collocation <lat>praelati et praedicatores</lat> usually refers to the bishops, priests, and other secular clerics responsible for the pastoral
care and instruction of the faithful. Canon 10 of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) emphasized the importance of preaching in pastoral care, requiring bishops to recruit suitable men to assist them in preaching and hearing confessions (<title>Conc. oec. decreta</title>, pp. 239-40), a function which from the early 1220s was increasingly taken over by the friars. The preachers are probably described as <me>treowe</me> to contrast them with the <lat>falsi praedicatores</lat> frequently attacked in the literature of the
time. This phrase could be used of heretics, of orthodox preachers who were vain or mercenary, of women, or even of the preaching orders themselves (see <ref target="#McDonnell-1954">McDonnell 1954</ref>, pp. 460-3); it it is most likely that the <title>AW</title> author, like his contemporary James of Vitry (see <title>Historia
Occidentalis</title>, ed. <ref target="#Hinnebusch-1972">Hinnebusch 1972</ref>, ch. 10) is thinking of the second category. </note>

makes it clear that <me>Ant hweðer . . .</me> begins a new sentence, but is hard to make sense of either its syntax or its logic as it appears in most of the MSS. Only V has a mark of punctuation (a point) after <me>wat</me>; the others seem from their punctuation to take <me>Godd wat</me> as governing the following clause, <me>ha . . . baðe</me>. But this means that the <me>hweðer</me> construction is not followed through; and what exactly does <me>noþeles</me> refer back to? A syntactical break after <me>wat</me> would make
much better sense of the text, and the link between <me>hweðer . . . blake</me> and <me>Godd wat</me> could easily have been missed by an early scribe because of the long intervening parenthesis. </note>

N adds <me>oþer i þe kuuele</me> <q>or in the cowl</q> (similarly PS; see <ref target="#AW-app-7">App. crit.</ref>), a reading which may reflect a later attempt to add balance by a reference to the monks. </note>

The <me>blake cape</me> (L <lat>cappa nigra</lat>) was worn
by regular canons (apart from the Premonstratensians, who wore white) and Dominican friars. The white rochet (like a surplice, but made of heavier linen) was worn by regular canons and (but only briefly, and not in England) by the early Dominicans. It is not clear what <me>þe grei cuuel</me> refers to. <ref target="#Fletcher-1993">Fletcher 1993</ref> raises three main possibilities: i) the habits of undyed wool used by the Cistercians (who are sometimes described as <q>grey</q> rather than <q>white</q> monks in contemporary
works), ii) the grey habits worn by the lay brothers of various orders, or iii) the grey habits of the early Franciscans (his preferred solution). A problem, however, is that <me>cuuel</me>, which he translates as <q>hood</q> (= Latin <lat>caputium</lat>), is
rather the ME equivalent of Latin <lat>cucullus/-a</lat>, the term for the long, sleeveless, hooded overgarment worn by monks (see <title>OED</title> <lat>s.v.</lat> <me>cowl</me> sb.1, <title>MED</title> <lat>s.v.</lat> <me>coule</me>; L has <lat>grisea cuculla</lat>), and James of Vitry (quoted p. 74) says that Franciscans do not wear <lat>cuculli</lat>. <ref target="#Allen-1918"> Allen 1918</ref>, p. 423, suggested the monks of Savigny, who wore grey habits; and a mid-thirteenth century model sermon by Humbert of Romans addresses <q>grey monks</q>, defined as <q>those of Tiron and some others</q>,

  context, to see that <me>hwet</me> might be corrupted into
  <me>wit</me>, it is very difficult to conceive of the simpler
  <me>wit</me> being corrupted or revised to <me>hwet</me>.</q> <ref target="#Hasenfratz-2000">Hasenfratz 2000</ref>, p. 485, however,
  notes the possibility of an accidental echo of the preceding
  <me>hwer</me>.

<note xml:id="N81" n="P. 104 (4v/1)" target="#P8"><label>of anes cunnes fuheles</label>:  This reading clearly caused some confusion in the MS tradition, and <ref target="#Ackerman-1984"> Ackerman and Dahood 1984</ref>, pp. 5-6, argue that the C reading, <me>of fif cunnes
foweles</me> (<q>birds of five kinds</q>), is preferable, since it more accurately describes the content of Part 3. But David compares himself only to three birds (Ps. 101: 6-8), and one of the two remaining birds mentioned in Part 3 is the ostrich, which
the anchoresses are warned not to imitate because of its earthbound nature. Comparison of the MS variants suggests i) that the original version had <me>anes</me>, not <me>fif</me> (which is unique to C, though S goes on to specify four birds, pelican, eagle, night-owl, and sparrow), and ii) that the phrase was capable of being misread as referring to a single species of bird (L has <lat>de natura cuiusdam avis</lat>, <q>of the nature of a
certain bird</q>), rather than the intended <q>birds of a particular kind</q>, i.e. the <q>birds of heaven</q>, which have little flesh and many feathers (see 3. 36r/11--36v/14);
the C reading may have been an attempt to rationalize this misunderstanding. </note>

<head>Glossary Conventions</head>
<!-- head type="sub">Richard Dance</head -->

<list type="gloss">
<label>Coverage</label>
<item>This is a glossary to the edited text only, and incorporates
neither the manuscript variants given in the Apparatus Criticus
nor the longer additions cited in the footnotes. For those forms
here listed that represent emendations to the base text (MS A), an
asterisk precedes the line reference. When further information
about a given instance (its etymology, sense, or interpretation in
context) is provided in the Notes, the letter <q>n</q> follows the line
reference.
   </item>
<label>Referencing</label>
<item>Reference is by Part and line number. Each different orthographic
and morphological form and significant sense variant is
exemplified. For practical reasons of space, however, only the
first instance of each usage is offered, together with an <q>etc.</q>
where more examples of the same occur later in the text. Those
readers in search of a full guide to the forms in MS A are advised
to consult the concordance in <ref target="#Potts-1993">Potts, Stevenson, and Wogan-Browne 1993</ref>.
   </item>
<label>Alphabetization and cross-reference</label>
<item>Entries are in alphabetical order, according to which yogh
[represented here by the numeral <q>3</q>] will be found after
&lt;g&gt;, and thorn and eth after &lt;t&gt;. The vocalic and consonantal significations of
&lt;i&gt;, &lt;u&gt;, and &lt;v&gt; are not distinguished for purposes
of alphabetical ordering. The prefix i- (= OE ge-) is always included
in determining this order, though in the majority of cases it appears
attached to the past participles of verbs whose stem is otherwise
found without it, in which case the said participial forms will be
found listed under the letter &lt;i&gt; for purposes of
cross-reference only. In general, cross-references are supplied
wherever they seem helpful (i.e., except in the immediate vicinity of
the main entry).</item>
<label>Format of entries</label>
<item>The format of entries is conventional, with headword and variant forms
in bold type, grammatical and other information in italics, and
senses in ordinary type. In most cases, orthographic/morphological
variant forms and their senses are listed together; where the
sense of a variant is not indicated, it should be referred back to
that given at the beginning of the entry or sub-entry. In the case
of words which have a particularly complex series of variant forms
and senses, the two are offered separately. Phrasing and idioms
that have been deemed to require further explanation are noticed
at the end of the section for each variant form or sense; here,
the symbol <q>~</q> stands for the headword (in any of its forms).
   </item></list>
<p>Wherever possible, the headword given is a form actually recorded
in the text, and the sense given then refers to this form, with
the meanings that attach to predictable inflexional variants
assumed. In the case of verbs, infinitives are preferred as
headword where these are found in the text; otherwise present
tense forms are listed before preterites, finite forms before
non-finite, and indicative (not usually stated), subjunctive, and
imperative in that order. Subjunctives are not usually recorded
separately where they would be identical in form with the
corresponding indicative, though exceptions will be found in the
event of significant differences in sense and usage between the
two. Datives of nouns (i.e., post-prepositional forms) are
likewise ordinarily offered only when different from non-oblique
forms, and the same is true with weak, dative, and plural forms of
adjectives (where 'weak' is understood to mean singular forms
inflected with -e after the definite article, etc.).
Accusative (understood to refer to the direct object only) and
dative are, however, normally offered separately in the case of
the personal pronouns owing to their frequent functional
distinction.
  </p>
<p>Abbreviations are conventional
